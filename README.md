## Reverse engineering the Coronavirus

See [`corona.py`](corona.py)

### Open questions
- How is orf1ab cleaved into polypeptides? Can we predict this from the sequence?
- Which protein is the immune system responding to?

### Work to be done
- Automatic extraction of genes from different coronaviruses
- Good multisequence compare tool
- Molecular dynamics?
